If you want to do a milspec trade up, you have to have all 10 skins be specs. The reason for this is because the outcome that you get has a rarity that is one level higher than the inputs that you used. So, for example, you can use 10 restricted skins to get one classified

skin. Also, a slight caveat. If you're doing a covert to gold tradeup, you actually only need five inputs for whatever reason. You can also mix conditions. So, you can use three factory new, seven minimal wear. You can just simply use all factory news. It really doesn't matter. But you cannot mix types. So, you can either use all normal skins or all stat track skins. Again, you cannot trade up souvenirs at all. So, now we know what we can put into a tradeup. But more importantly, what can we get out of it? As I already

said before, you get one skin that is one higher rarity than the inputs you used. And what the skin itself actually is is randomly chosen from one of the collections that you used inputs from. Unsurprisingly, if you use normal skins, the outcome's going to be normal. And if you use Statrack skins, the outcome's going to be Stat Track. And perhaps most importantly, the condition of the skin that you get can be determined exactly, but it is quite complicated to do so. And there will be a dedicated section to

this later in the video. In a nutshell, no. If you use 10 factory new skins, you're not guaranteed to get a factory new outcome. It depends on a lot of factors. So, for a quick example, let's say you used five restricted normal snake bite skins in your tradeup, and you also added in five restricted normals from the Prisma case, then you'll get a normal classified skin from either the snake bite case or the Prisma case. And if you use 10 stat track milspecs from the kilowatt case, you're

going to get one stat track restricted from the kilowatt case. Floats are incredibly important when it comes to trade-ups, and you have to get them right because if you don't, it could cost you a lot of money. These two MP7 white outs look basically the same, and their float values are incredibly close, but their monetary values couldn't be further apart. So, make sure that you watch this whole section and pay extra close attention because it will be very important. Most skins in Counterstrike

come with a number called the float value, which is a number between 0ero and one, and it shows you how worn the skin is. Taking a look at the M4 Teams that we saw in the first chapter, here's a 0.01 float one with barely any scratches. And here's a 791, which is as worn as it comes. The lower the float value of a skin is, the better the condition is, and therefore the less scratches it shows. Remember when we talked about conditions? So that was factory, new, minimal wear, fuel tested,

wellworn, and battle scarred. Each skin is sorted into one of these five categories based on its float value. And here are the cutoff points. So if your skin has a 0.06 float, that's going to be a factory new skin. And if your skin has a 0.35 float, that's going to be a field tested skin. The reason floats are super important is that because it not only affects the look of the skin, it also heavily affects the price. The battle scard M4 Tamuka is $28 while the factory new one is $125. On the Steam

market and on pretty much any other marketplace, skins are grouped by condition. So if you were to list your 0.16 float field tested M4 Tuka and your 0.37 float field tested M4 Tamuka, they'd be listed under the same market page. This is pretty important when it comes to getting inputs, but more about that later. But even if you inspect these two field tested M4, you'll notice some drastic differences. This is the6 one. It does have some scratches, but not too many. And this is the 37 one. It

is a lot more scratched. But have you been wondering why I wasn't showing you a 99 float M4 since I said earlier that floats range between 0 and 1? That's because of what are known as float caps. Generally, floats range from 0 to one. But there are many skins where the float range doesn't cover the full float cap. For example, the M4 Teamuka only covers the float range from 0 to 0.8. The Teamuka has an upper float cap where the float doesn't quite reach one, but you could also have a lower float cap where

the minimum float is higher than zero. For example, the MP7 white out has a lower float cap of 0.06 and an upper float cap of 0.8. This also has the effect of making the factory new MP7 wide out super rare because it's only a 0.01 wide section of it that falls into the factory new range. This will make it incredibly hard to trade up to it in factory new and it's also the reason why the factory new version is super expensive. You definitely don't have to know all the floats of all the skins by

heart. There's plenty of websites that tell you what these float caps are. For example, trade-up spy and trade-up spy is also just a very useful tool for trade-ups in general. They tell you the float cap. They tell you what collection it's from. They tell you what the rarity is. And they even show a bunch of prices on various different marketplaces. But let's get back to floats and trade-ups. The float of the outcome skin that you get from a trade-up used to be only determined by the average float of the

inputs. But as of the knife trade-up update, this is no longer the case. It's now determined by the average adjusted float value. So it adds an extra step to the calculation. Here is how you calculate the adjusted float for one skin. Essentially, the way to think about this is if you have a float cap skin, you stretch out the float caps to be 0 to one, and where the float lands is your adjusted float value. So, essentially, we're turning every single skin into a full float cap skin. So,

let's take a look at an example. If you have a skin with the float cap of 0.06 to 0.8, such as the AK Safari mesh, and the float of it is 0.069999, 069999. Then if you use it in a trade-up, it's going to act as if it had a float of 0.0135. Once you calculated the adjusted float for each of your 10 inputs, you just have to average them. So add them all up, divide them by 10, and now we have the adjusted average float. This is what each output float is going to be determined by. And the floats are not

random, but they do depend on the maximum and the minimum float cap of the particular outcome skin. So, not all possible outcome skins are going to have the same float, but you can individually calculate the exact float that you will get before you even attempt the trade-off. This is the general formula for calculating the floats for an outcome with the adjusted average float. Plugging the numbers into this formula will always work, but there are some simplifications that you can make if your skin doesn't have a float cap or if

it only has an upper float cap. Now, I do know that this is quite complicated and I think it's important for you to sort of understand what's going on, but don't worry. you won't have to run these calculations manually every time you want to do trade-ups. That's where trade-up spy comes in. It just gives you the float value based on the input skins that you want to use. Now, if you want to figure out what adjusted average float you need to get a skin in a certain condition, let's say a 0.06

float cap skin in factory new, then this is the formula that you will use. And if we plug in some numbers to get the adjusted average float for a factory new 0.06 to 0.8 eight float cap skin, then the adjusted average float should be 0.0135 repeating. Now, if you've been doing trade-ups before the knife trade-up update, then you do kind of need to relearn these formulas because they did change. One of the biggest changes is that now within a collection, it kind of does matter which input you use because

if they have different flow caps, they're going to give you different outcome floats. So, be very, very careful. And if you're not sure, always just double check your floats on Trade-Up Spy. A good rule of thumb though is that if you're trying to trade up to a particular skin, then take a look at what skins trade up to it. And if there's one that's a lot cheaper than the others, then double check the float caps because maybe it works out in such a way where it's not actually super

useful for that trade-up. Again, you probably don't have to use these formulas on a daily basis, but you need to understand how they work. Another interesting side effect of the new trade-up update is that you can now use float cap skins for low float trade-ups. Here's an example of what's possible. Now, previously, to get a factory new M4 radiation hazard, you'd have to use a lowflat minimal wear industrial nuke skin and a bunch of train collection fillers that are really, really low

floats, like06 or even lower. But now, we can use these float capped AUG condemns from the safe house collection. And finding these fillers is actually pretty easy. They're quite common on the Steam market. So now it's not just the absolute value of the float that matters for trade-ups, but rather what matters is how close that is to the skin's lower float cap. So in this example, the 0.064 float ag condemned with a 0.06 float cap actually counts as a05 float skin. And that's pretty much it for floats. This

was the hardest part of trade-ups, and it is now over. While floats got a lot more complicated with the recent trade-up update, the probabilities of getting each outcome is now a lot simpler to calculate. Previously, you had to consider a bunch of things, such as how many outcomes there are in a certain collection. But now, none of that matters. And the way to calculate odds is very, very simple. You simply take the number of skins from a certain collection, and that many times 10% is your probability to hit a skin from that

collection. Here's a random trade-up just to demonstrate how this works. So, we have one Norse Collection skin, meaning that we have overall a 10% chance to hit a Norse collection skin. We have four fever inputs for 40% to hit Fever and five Phoenix inputs for 50% to hit Phoenix. Each collection does have multiple outcomes, though, and each of those outcomes within a collection is equally likely. So, with our 10% chance to hit a Norse collection skin and there being three Norse collection skins, each

of them is going to have a 3.33% chance of showing up from this trade-up. Likewise, with the 50% for the Phoenix collection and four outcomes, we just divide that by four, which gives us 12 1.5% for each Phoenix skin. And the 40% for the fever with five outcomes is going to give us an 8% chance for each of the fever outcomes. It may seem complicated right now, but trust me, it is very intuitive how this works. Essentially, the only thing you have to know is one skin from one collection adds another 10% to getting that

collection. There are a few niche cases where the odds are not exactly equal between the different outcomes, but these are generally just for super expensive trade-ups such as Glock Emerald trade-ups. We're not actually quite sure what the odds are for each of the phases now after the trade-up update. We're just kind of assuming that they're all equally likely, and the odds also aren't equal for all knives. In some cases, Dopplers are a little bit more common than they should be, and

gems are of course much rarer than any other finish. But because knife trade-ups are so expensive and some of these odds are super duper low, we don't actually know for certain that these are the odds, but it's likely very close. But regardless, you don't actually need to be able to calculate the odds because if you just construct the trade-up on trade-offs by.com, it will just tell you what the odds are. But in order for you to find good trade-ups, which I'll get into in a little bit, it's good to have

an intuition of how it works. I think it's pretty safe to say that most people doing profitable trade-ups are doing them to profit. And that's obviously because skins are worth real money. And we can actually quantify how good a trade-up is in just one number. This is known as the profitability value. It's generally given as a percentage and it tells you how much money you're expected to get back on average when you do the trade-up a lot of times. Now, when you input a trade-up into trade-up spy, it

does give you a profitability value. But a lot of the time, this is not super accurate. So, we have to figure it out ourselves, or at least we have to adjust some things to make it accurate. And to do that, first we need to figure out a way to get an accurate price for each of the possible outcome skins. Pricing skins is a topic for its own video, so I'm not going to go too in-depth about it. But for most relatively cheap, profitable trade-ups, all you have to do is open the Steam listing page, look at

the graph, and see what the highest price is that it consistently sells for. So here, for example, on this tradeup, you have to go through all the skins. Let's start with the Mac 10 Heat. We're just going to open the Steam listing page, scroll down to the graph, and as you can see, the average sales price is between 27 and $28. So we'll call it 27.50. That's the price we're going to use. You simply go through every single skin. Yes, this is going to take a while, but if you want an accurate

number, then you're going to have to do it. And the way trade-up spy calculates the profitabilities, it's pretty simple. It's just a lot of calculations. You just take the price of each outcome. You multiply it by its own percentage, and you add up all those numbers across all the outcomes. This will give you what is known as the expected value, and then you simply divide that by the cost of the trade-up, which will turn into a percentage, which is the profitability. Now, if you're doing trade-ups on Steam,

you're going to want to go up here and change no fees to show both. This is going to show the profitability with no fees considered and the profitability with Steam fees already calculated in this trade-up particularly is pretty ass. A 40.52% profitability is absolutely garbage. So, you should not do it under any circumstances. But if you have a trade-up like this where the profitability after fees is 158% that is ridiculously good. And as you can see it's marked in green. Everything above

100% is going to be green because 100% is the break even value. But let's talk a little bit deeper about what this profitability figure means. If it's green it doesn't mean that you're automatically guaranteed to profit. That's not how this works. But rather it means that statistically on average you are expected to profit. You could get unlucky and hit 10 Nova Yorkers in a row, losing every time. But the more of these trade-ups you do, the more likely it becomes that you'll get exactly 25%

USPs, 25% scouts, 25% P250s, and 25% novas. And this is where the profitability is really going to mean something. Say you do a million of these tradeups, you'd spend 1.9 million on it. then you're pretty much guaranteed to get back $1.9 million times 158%. Meaning that you're expected to get back around $3 million worth of skins. Obviously, you're not going to drop millions of dollars on tradeups. But the reason I said millions of dollars is because you really need to do a lot of

these trade-ups to get consistent results. But as long as all the trade-ups that you do are profitable over time, once you do enough, you should end up in profit. although again it's never guaranteed. Now that we know the theory behind tradeups, it is time to get started. And to do that, we're going to be using some tools. And the first one is going to be the CS float market checker extension. This is a pretty simple Chrome extension that you can install. And once you've done that, it'll show you the floats of your items

in your inventory and more importantly on the Steam market on the listings themselves. The second extension we're going to be using is called the CS2 Trader extension. This is going to allow us to mass list items on the Steam market so that we don't have to do it manually one by one. There's a bunch of other features as well, but really the mass listing feature is going to be the only one that we're interested in. And the third and final tool that we're going to be using is going to be

trade-ups by.com. I already mentioned this website extensively, but this really is the core tool that you're going to be using to calculate your trade-ups. You can load up your inventory and choose skins that you have to add to the trade-up calculator directly. It'll tell you what you can get, what the float will be of that outcome, what the odds are of getting that outcome, but we'll get into how to use the calculator well in the trade-up walkthrough section later on. And Tradeup Spy also has a skin information

database where you can look at float caps and other information about skins. No, Trade-Up Spy did not sponsor this video. It's really just the best website out there to calculate trade-ups. We now have all the tools that we need for profitable trade-ups, but the hardest thing is still ahead of us. getting lowflat skins and I'm going to show you four methods that can help you get them. The first one is going to be buy orders on Steam. So to get started, head to the community market, head to Counter Strike

2. Search with the filters for the items that you want. I'm looking for Sport and Field Industrials and Minimal Wear. I'm specifically looking for the FAMAS half sleeve and minimal wear. Now you're simply going to hit place buy order. And here you're going to set your price. I'm gonna say 19 cents because that is the current highest buy order price and however many you want to buy. Right now, my balance is not very high. So, let's set buy orders for four of them. Just agree to the subscriber agreement, place

order, and just wait. Your buy orders will be automatically filled. Now, a few things about buy orders. As soon as they fill, you will be able to trade them up. So, if I take these 10 skins, let's slap them in a trade up and let's see what we get. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom, boom, and boom. Small game is not the best outcome, but as you can see, I am instantly able to trade them up. However, if you get bad floats, you won't be able to instantly resell them. You're going to have to wait 8

days, and you are going to get bad floats because on Steam, you cannot set a certain float range that you want your buy order to be set for. You're just going to get every single float that gets filled on your buy order for the minimum wear condition. Later, we're going to have to sort through these inputs, and I am going to show you the best way to do that in a later section in this video where I walk through the whole profitable trade-up process. Another way to get low floats for tradeups is to snipe the Steam market.

So, head to the Steam Market, Counter Strike 2, select the skins that you're looking for. Once again, it's going to be the Sport and Field Collection, Minimaware, Industrial Grades, and I'm only looking for the FAMAS. So, we're going to click on the FAMAS. And if you have the CSV vote market checker extension installed, then you should have a bunch of stuff right here. You need to select 100 and sort by float. And this will sort the page by floats. So you'll see the lowest float at the

top. Unfortunately, this is a little bit too high. So if that is the case, we can head to the second page of the Steam market. Boom. Again, just sort by float. That's a little bit higher than what we want. We want to float under 0.1, but it's going to be close enough where I'm just going to buy it. And let's move on to the next page. Let's see. Now, you can see here it's 21 cents instead of 20. So, if you buy anything here, it's going to cut into your profit margin. So, be cognizant of how much you're

paying. But unfortunately, it seems like that was all that I could buy right now from the Steam market. If this is the method that you're using, you're going to want to refresh the page every 10 or 15 minutes or so. you'll see new items listed and if there's a good float one again just buy it. Now there are some obvious drawbacks but there are some good things about this method. The good thing is that you get to decide what you buy. So you only buy lowflat skins. You don't have to worry about reselling bad

floats. But the bad thing is obviously it's going to be a little bit more expensive because you're buying listings instead of buy orders and it's going to take hella time that you're on the steam market looking for lowflat items. Another method to get lowflat skins or trade-ups is to use instant trading sites such as skin swap. Let's take a look at an example. If I search for the saw off analog input and let's take a look at these minimal wear ones. Notice that all of them cost $1.31 regardless

of the float value. So a.131 costs $1.31, but a 0.081 also costs $1.31. Same with the 0.085. So you can get lowflat trade-up inputs for zero overpay. But that's not all because they have a Chinese markets feature where you get access to the Chinese markets for only a 1% fee. And not only can you get loatos here as well, it also tends to be cheaper than western marketplaces. Let's take a look at another example. This brand new skin, the scout calligrapho in factory new on a western marketplace costs $11. But if

I search for it here on skin swap with the Chinese market feature factory new. There we go. You can buy one right now for just $3.37 and it gets delivered instantly. Now obviously this is a brand new skin. So this is an extreme example of how much you can save, but most skins tend to be cheaper in Chinese marketplaces. So make sure you take advantage of this feature before prices equalize. The fourth and final way to get low float skins for trade-ups is to use third-party western marketplaces. For example, if I look for

the FAMAS here, you'll notice that it actually costs 21 cents and this is not Steam value. This is cash value. So, it's in reality even more. But I can sort by floats. So, if I set the maximum float to be 0.1, then you'll only be shown the right float skins. But again, they are quite expensive and this is cash value. So consider that too. You could also set buy orders. If you click on the skin, you'll see the buy orders here on the left. You can set specific buy orders for specific floats. So the

highest one we have here that's already set is for 23 cents for a float value of between 0.1 and 0.07. To set your own buy order, just hit create advanced. The skin's already going to be filled out for you. And you're just going to have to change the float value, the float range. I'm going to change it to 0.1 to 0.07. And let's beat this buy order by 1 cent. So, we're going to pay 24 cents per item. Set however many buy orders you'd like. Make sure that you set it up

correctly. If you set it up wrong, you might lose money. And hit place buy order. Boom. That's really it. Now, you just got to wait and you're going to be sent skins. Again, the only drawback with this is that it's going to be more expensive, but on the other hand, it's going to be way faster. There's going to be no bad floats, and it's going to take very little effort on your end. So, at this point, you know all the theory behind tradeups. You have all the tools to get started. So, let's get started.

I'm going to walk through the whole process right now of doing a profitable trade up from the beginning. So, from finding the trade up through getting the inputs, then sorting the inputs, doing the tradeup, and finally reselling the outcomes. First, we need to find the trade-up that we're going to be doing. I like to do this on Tradeup Spy. So, head over to the website, head to the calculator page. My preferred trade-up rarity is industrial grade when you start out with a cheap budget. So, we're

going to select that. Then, we're going to add a skin. And it's going to be a little hard at first. You might have to play around a lot, but once you've played around with it, you'll notice some patterns. And a pattern that I noticed is that the Sport and Field collection has some pretty solid trade-ups. We'll go for minimal wares, trying to craft factory new skins. And you'll notice that the FAMAS has the little yellow F button. That means it has a 0.1 float cap, which is ideal for

trade-ups because the math is going to be really easy. I already kind of know that a 0.1 float is going to be low enough to get us into the factory new range for all of these skins. And now we have the first skin added. We're just going to duplicate it. We're going to double check the price to make sure that this 15 cents is correct. We're going to hit the Steam button. And actually, it's not correct. There's 19 cent buy orders and 20 cent listings. For this tradeup, we're going to use buy orders. So, we'll

call them 19 cents. And let me just make sure that's applied to all of these FAMAS. And if we scroll down, the prices are once again not correct. So, now we have to add the prices again to the outcomes. So, we just hit the Steam button, check the price. This seems to be $5.35 cheapest listing. And then we just go through the other three skins as well. So, the Scout will be $259, the P250 will be 243, and the Novas will be 141. So, here we are. I now constructed a trade up where we can get the inputs. We

have the outcomes and it's a profitability of nearly 135% after Steam fees. So, this is going to be the trade-up that we're going to be using. So, our goal is to get 10 minimum wear FAMAS half sleeves under an average float of 0.1. This is now our starting point. We know exactly what skins we need to get. Now, there are certain things that I can't really teach you through a video, and one of them is finding profitable trade-ups. Really all that you have to do is play around with trade-up spy for a while and once you

have all the skin knowledge and once you've found a bunch of profitable trade-up you'll be able to basically extrapolate from there and find new profitable trade-ups. But again, we're looking for FAMAS's under a float of 0.1. So to do that, we're going to use buy orders. To set those up, you're going to want to head to the community market, select Counter Strike 2, show advanced options. Under the collection, select the Sport and Field collection. Exterior is minimal wear. Quality is

industrial grade. Open the page for the FAMAS. And if I hit view more details, you'll see all the buy orders. So, a 19cent buy order is going to be ideal in this case. And I'm just going to set however many my balance allows. I have quite a large balance right now. So, we're going to set 4,000 buy orders. Your buy orders are now all set. Now, all you have to do is wait until your skins start rolling in. Now, the video that you're seeing right now is a little bit of a recreation. I forgot to record,

so I just took a bunch of them off the Steam market. But this is what it's going to look like. They're just going to be delivered into your inventory. When I did this, I got around a hundred of them per day, which is honestly pretty solid. But a little limitation with buy orders is that while you can trade up the skins right away, you can't resell them for 7 days after the buy order has filled. Previously, as soon as you got the bad float skins, you'd just relist them on the Steam market right

away. But, as I just said, you can't do that anymore. So, there's really two options you can do. One is you can just leave them in your inventory. But, I find that a little annoying. So, what I prefer to do is get a storage unit, call it bad floats, and I go through every single skin, inspect them one by one, and if the skin has a float of above.11, I just slap it in the bad float storage unit. This is where your bad float skins are going to sit until they become marketable and you can resell them. Once

you've moved all the bad floats into storage units, you should be left with a bunch of lowflat FAMAS half sleeves, specifically under a float of 0.11. And you may think that we're ready to just slap them in a storage unit, but we're not quite ready. We're going to have to double check that we have the right combination to get all the skins in factory new. To do this, we're going to head over to Tradeup Spy. Once you're here, head to the calculator and click open CS2 inventory. We're going to be

loading up our CS2 inventory. Now, when you do this for the first time, you're going to have to install the extension. So, hit the question mark. Hit this where it says Chrome web store. Then, you're going to want to add this to Chrome. Add extension. Head back to Tradeup Spy. Then, you're going to want to click on the extension, click refresh your inventory. Just wait until this loads. This usually does take a while. Just be patient. There we go. The inventory has been refreshed. We can now

go back to the website. Click get latest inventory from extension. Then load all floats. I know this seems like a lot of steps, but once you do it a couple times, I promise it's going to be second nature. Scroll down to where you see the FAMASes. And I like to just start off with the first 10. Let's see if the combination is correct. So, it is. We are going to get these three skins in factory new and this one a minimum aware, which is expected. But we're actually quite far from the maximum

float that we can get away with. Remember, it's 0.1. We're at just over 0.09. So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to replace some of these lower float skins with higher float ones. So, replace that 0.081 with the 0.096, for example. Delete that. Add this in. We're just kind of optimizing to get the highest possible float without going over the threshold. I see that I can replace the 0.084 with this 0.097, which will help us as well. And based off of the floats that we have here, I think

that is going to be roughly the highest that we can get. So, we're just going to go for this. We now have a combination of 10 skins with the exact right floats. So, what I like to do is I like to take out my phone, take a picture of this screen, or I mean, if you have a second monitor, you can just put it up on the second monitor. Then, we go back to CS2. Once you're back in CS2, you're just going to want to find those exact 10 skins and put them into the tradeup. That's a little bit too low, so we're

going to skip that. Same with that. That one's going to go in. And our final one right here. So, let's pray for that USB Alpine camo. Let's do our first profitable trade up. Boom. Of course, we get the one loss outcome. You have got to be kidding me, Gabin. But you get the point. You've now done your first profitable trade up. Now, I set a lot more buy orders than what you just saw. So, I ended up doing a lot more trade-ups. And this is actually the best way to do trade-ups. If you can find a

really profitable trade-up and you can spam the crap out of it, then you're going to be more than likely to actually make money according to the profitability. But once you've done your trade-ups, you're not quite done yet. We still have bad floats that we have to deal with, and we have the outcomes that we have to deal with. Dealing with the bad floats is not too bad. You just open your storage unit. You take out all the bad floats that you've been saving up. Depending on how many trade-ups you've

done, it is likely that these are already tradable.
